How to find problems worth solving with the OFH

Step 1: Select a human-made object
Step 2: Describe the problem it solves or tries to solve
Step 3: ??? (maybe learn about the physical properties of the objects and study previous solutions)
Step 4: Use the OFH to find an alternative solution.

Terms I found to be useful:
  Toy insight problem: A problem that only requires general knowledge about the situation in order to solve. 
  Real-world insight problem: A problem that requires field-specific knowledge about objects in order to solve. 

Idea: We could train ourselves in the use of the OFH by solving toy insight problems first, which are easier. Nonetheless, we may need to
develop a method that allows us to tackle real-world insight problems. Such a method may include learning about the field beforehand. 

Examples of existing toy insight problems and where they can be found: 
	Prisoner-and-rope Problem: (Issac & Just, 1995 [Constraints on Thinking in Insight and Invention])
	Candle Problem: (Dunker, 1945 [On Problem Solving])
	Circuit Problem: (Glucksberg & Dranks, 1968 [Effects of discriminative labels and of nonsense lables upon availability of novel function])
	Stuck-truck Problem: (http://www.thinkriddles.com/stuck-semi-riddle-785.html)
	2-Rings Problem, Desk-lamp Problem, Wrist-watch Problem, Hot-coals Problem: (McCaffrey, 2011 [The Obscure Features Hypothesis For
		Innovation: One Key to Improving Human Innovation])

What needs to be done next: Find similar toy insight problems and post a file that contains multiple samples so readers can exercise 
the skill.

The Generic Parts Technique

Terms I found to be useful:
  Functional Fixedness: To overlook or be oblivious to the parts, materials, shape and/or size of objects involved in a problem. (defined 
		by McCaffrey in his paper, Innovation Relies on the Obscure: A Key to Overcoming the Classic Problem of Functional Fixedness)
  
How the OFH proposes we fix functional fixedness: Describe object parts, materials, sizes and shapes of objects in terms that do not 
suggest their purpose. For example, a cardboard box suggests that something can be put inside it. If we rephrase it as a hollow 
cardboard cube, it no longer suggests that its purpose is to be a container. It could be anything at all! 

This can be further refined into a process, called the Generic Parts Technique (GPT). 
Step 1: Break down an object into its parts recursively, until no more breakdowns are possible.
Step 2: Rephrase each resulting part until it is impossible to infer what its original purpose was. 
(needs an example to illustrate the process)

To do list:
1. Extract Hirtz et al's list of 200 engineering verbs. (find it in the references of the papers found in the wiki)
1.1. Obtain a complete copy of Hirtz's paper
1.2. Transcribe the 200 verbs to a github code file
1.3. Make a list of 2 or more ideas that still need to be extracted from the same paper. 

2. Make a 4 item list including the 4 cognitive obstacles to innovation.
2.1. Create a dedicated page for each of these cognitive obstacles. Include problem statment and proposed solution.

3. Create a dedicated page that contains toy insight problems for training purposes. Spoiler link to possible solutions.
